# Cosmic center index <img align="right" width="10%" src="assets/cosmic.png">

Cosmic Center Index is the source index of recipes of the [Cosmic](https://cosmic.pages.obspm.fr/cosmic/) package repository for [Conan](https://conan.io).

## Installation

`conan` is a package manager for C and C++ projects. It is designed to be portable and extensible, allowing you to install and manage dependencies for your projects.

We offer a script to streamline the installation of Conan and the setup of the Cosmic repository. This script will install Conan, configure it, add the Cosmic repository, and populate the local cache.

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raplonu/cosmic-center-index/master/install.sh | bash
```

It is still possible to skip some steps:

```bash
# Skip everything ! ðŸ™ˆðŸ™‰ðŸ™Š
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raplonu/cosmic-center-index/master/install.sh | bash -s -- --skip-install --skip-configure --skip-populate
```

## Add Cosmic Center Index (WIP)

Cosmic also provides for users a remote in addition of this index. To add the remote, run:

```bash
conan remote add cosmic https://conan.obspm.fr/conan
```

Remote is prefered since they are automatically updated and provide the latest version of the packages.

## How to consume recipes

Starting to use recipes from this repository is as easy as running
one simple command after installing Conan:

```bash
conan install name/version@ [-g <generator>]
```

Of course, we really encourage you to use a `conanfile.txt` or `conanfile.py`
to list all the requirements or your project and install them all together
(Conan will build a single graph and ensure congruency).

:warning: It is very important to notice that recipes will evolve over time
and, while they are fixing some issues, they might introduce new features and
improvements, and your project can break if you upgrade them
([How to prevent these breaking changes in my project?](docs/consuming_recipes.md)).

## Reporting Issues

You can open issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/conan-io/conan-center-index/issues) to:

* :bug: Report **bugs/issues** in a package:
    - Use the `[package]` tag in the title of the issue to help identifying them.
    - If you detect any issue or missing feature in a package, for example, a build failure or a recipe that not support a specific configuration.
    - Specify the name and version (`zlib/1.2.11`) and any relevant details about the fail configuration: Applied profile, building machine...

* :bulb: Request a **new library** to be added:
    - Use the `[request]` label to search the library in the issue tracker in case it was already requested.
    - If not, use the same `[request]` tag in the title of the issue to help identifying them.
    - Indicate the name and the version of the library you would like to have in the repository. Also links to the project's website,
      source download/repository and in general any relevant information that helps creating a recipe for it.

*  :robot: Report **a failure** in the CI system:
    - If you open a Pull Request and get an unexpected error you might comment in the failing PR.
    - If the service or repository is down or failing, use the `[service]` tag in the title of a new issue to help identifying them.
